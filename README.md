Run ansible-mikrotik-auto-upgrade.sh one by one (each new command are separated by new line :D) don't run with: 'chmod +x ansible-mikrotik-auto-upgrade.sh && ./ansible-mikrotik-auto-upgrade.sh' but it's okay if you have other ways :) *DWYOR* and by the way this repo just a self note for me :) and you also need some improvement and adjustment if you want to deploy in your network
